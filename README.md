# aria2c-gui

aria2c-gui is a gradio-powered web application GUI for easier use of aria2c.

## Usage

To use aria2c-gui, you need to have gradio installed. You can install it easily using pip.

```
$ pip install gradio
```

You also need the aria2c.exe file. The one I included in this repository is modified to be able to download with more connections per server.
You can download the original version from [here](https://github.com/aria2/aria2/releases/).

Then, you can run the application using the following command.

```
$ gradio app.py
```
